# Down for Maintenance

• Currently Shadow is down for Maintenance, there was an error which caused a full rewrite.
The new code will be posted soon in place of this. We apologize for the inconvenience.


# Update

• Shadow is online in basic mode.
We are implementing her features before enabling her message systems.
This will hopefully bring a "Full Service" feel and give users the feeling nothing big happened. ^.^
