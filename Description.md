Shadow is a Moderation bot who's side feature is an RPG that can be played cross-server. Users can interact with one another from there "Houses"(Servers) and War with one another.

Shadow has before, and will again, feature "Rifts" global "Chat Rooms" similar to that of an IRC. This feature was initially created to bring users together without them being in the same server. Now it'll also be used to communicate to other S.RPG Houses.

Currently, as of April 5'th Moderation is still being implimented, and Rifts, although simple, have yet to be added. Our current main focus is on the RPG and other random miscellaneous things that are more for fun or entertainment than for actual productivity. (However, these lil' things have built to interesting things in previous reboots of Shadow.)
